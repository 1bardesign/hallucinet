# Hallucinet

**(Currently under construction)**

Hallucinet is a visual toy utilising neural nets to generate pretty pictures and animations.

Networks and inputs can be generated and modifed interactively, and random configurations can be explored.

# Accessibility

Hallucinet can produce intense, flashing visuals. Photosensitive individuals please proceed with caution!

# Requirements and Installation

**Everyone:**

- Up to date graphics drivers.
- GPU with at least 1GB of effective VRAM - running with less is possible but will severely limit the length of animation.
	2GB and up is recommended, faster/newer GPUs will do a better job of the heavy workload.

**Windows:**

- Only tested on Windows 10
- Get the .zip version
- Extract somewhere
- Run the exe

**Linux/MacOS:**

- Get the .love Version
- LÖVE 11+ Locally Installed
- Run the .love file with LÖVE
- YMMV
