# Hallucinet

Hallucinet is a visual toy utilising neural nets to generate pretty pictures and animations.

Networks and inputs can be generated independently, and random configurations can be explored.

# Accessibility

Hallucinet can produce intense, flashing visuals. Photosensitive individuals please proceed with caution!

# Requirements and Installation

**Everyone:**

- Up to date graphics drivers, please!
- GPU with at least 1GB of effective VRAM. Running with less is possible, but will severely limit the length of animations. 2GB and up is recommended.
- Performance scales directly with GPU power, so a faster/newer GPU will result in nicer images, faster.

**Windows:**

- Get the .zip version
- Extract somewhere
- Run the exe
- Only tested on Windows 10

**Linux/MacOS/Windows LÖVE User:**

- Get the .love Version
- [LÖVE 11+](http://love2d.org/) Locally Installed
- Run the .love file with LÖVE

# Usage

There's a tutorial explaining all the available options inside the application.

# Screensaver Mode

Hallucinet contains a screensaver mode which runs full screen, generates a random still image every 5 minutes, and closes on any input.

To run Hallucinet in screensaver mode, pass `screensaver` in as a command line argument. If you're having trouble with that, please let me know.
